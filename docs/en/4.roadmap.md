This section reflects generic plans for future releases. However, this can be changed any time.

If you need something special or urgent please refer to [repo issues](https://github.com/13g10n/aiogram-forms/issues).

### 1.1.x
Extend **tests** and **docs**, increase **coverage** and add **more generic** forms, fields and validators.

### 1.2.x
Add new submodule - **menus**. Link menu buttons to other menus, forms of even plain callable handlers.
